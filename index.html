  <p>I have many likes and dislikes. One of my likes includes travelling, which you can find a page on in the "likes" page when you click, "traveling". I've lived in Jackson for my whole life. I have an interest in spanish, animals, and nature. As you navigate
    this site, please feel free to let me know of anything I should add or take off. Thanks! Enjoy! </p>

      <p>I really hope that you like my site, Mrs. Newberry. I've learned a lot of code that I didn't know. I enjoy coding a little more than I thought I would. </p>
